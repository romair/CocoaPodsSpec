#   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.

  s.description      = <<-DESC
Traverson allows you to follow the relation links within the HATEOAS-based API's response instead of harcoding every single url.
In addition, the built-in features allow you:
- manage header info sent to server
- handle URI tempalte variables
- use different types of authentication
